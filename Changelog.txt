Changelog by December 4, 2020:
 
 1. Model persistence is implemented, we can now save model to disk or load model from disk.
 
 2. Onehot encoding/decoding algorithms are optimized, the speed is supposed to be faster.
 
 3. Min-batching is optimized.
 
 4. SGD is optimized.
 
 5. Fixed a bug in training, we should re-initialize weights when we re-train, otherwise the previous weights will affect our results.
 
 6. Fixed a bug when loading model from disk, we compare its signature to guarantee the content is compatible and correct with current version and class.
 
 7. More activation functions (sigmoid, tanh and relu) are supported.
